         <h2>Evaluating conflict surrounding mineral extraction in Ghana: Assessing the spatial interactions of large and small-scale mining</h2>

          <h4><i>The Extractive Industries and Society,</i> Volume 3, Issue 2, April 2016, Pages 450-463, ISSN 2214-790X<hr></h4>

          <p>In January 2016 my master's thesis work looking at the spatial overlaps of small and large-scale mining in south-central Ghana was accepted to <i>Extractive Industries and Society</i>. The abstract and figures from the paper are below, and the full text can be found online <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X16300065" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

          <div class="well well-sm"><p>Since implementation of its Economic Recovery Program in 1983, Ghana’s extractive industries have come to account for 40% of the total value of the country’s exports. An adverse impact of this increase, however, has been increased extraction-related conflict due to heightened competition between large and small-scale operators over mineral-rich lands. This paper characterizes these conflicts in the south-central section of the country by mapping the spatial overlaps between large and small-scale miners. Classification tree analysis of 2013 and 2015 Landsat- 7 and -8 imagery was used to identify small-scale mine sites. The overlaps between these sites and large-scale concessions are examined in the context of reported mining conflicts. Results reveal that there is a large amount of resource competition between the two parties, specifically, more than half (i.e., 52%) of the identified small-scale mining activity occurs within the boundaries of large-scale concessions. The northwest corner of the study area contains 50% of the identified overlaps; the southwest corner contains 40%; and the northeast corner contains 10%. In most cases, these overlaps take place on prospecting concessions. The work illustrates how mapping and quantifying areas of spatial overlap between large and small-scale miners can help stakeholders implement more effective policy solutions.</p></div>
