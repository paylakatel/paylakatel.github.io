2010 and realized there was an opportunity to make important information 
about the Town more accessible for residents. </p><p>As the Town’s webmaster, I lead the project and made sure we addressed the 
feedback we’d be hearing from residents: it was difficult to find  
information. Folks pointed out that the large nested menus 
were hard to navigate, having two separate and un-connected document 
repositories were confusing, and it was hard to know what to pay attention 
to when visiting the site. </p><hr><br><div class="images"><div class="img"><img border="1" src="../projects/img/acton-old-site.png" alt=""><p class="img-title">Old Town hompage</p><p class="img-details"></p></div><div class="img"><img border="1" src="../projects/img/acton-new-site.png" alt=""><p class="img-title">Homepage after redesign</p><p class="img-details"></p></div></div><hr><p>We addressed these concerns in a variety of different ways when thinking 
about the new site:</p><ul> <li>We made the homepage longer and stopped compressing everything we 
needed to fit onto the page in a small area. Doing that allowed us to 
separate out content into sections: News & Events, Online Services, 
Ongoing Activity, and Connect With Us that were more intuitive for users. </li><li>We realized most users use our search bar to find what they’re 
looking for, so we increased it’s size and moved it to a prominent 
location on the page.</li><li>We integrated our site with our other documents repository: <a href="http://doc.acton-ma.gov/dsweb/HomePage">docushare </a>, using a Google Site Searches to help people find information 
across the two sites. </li></ul><!-- jQuery--><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script><!-- bootstrap js--><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><footer> <p><a href="paylakatel@gmail.com" class=" fa fa-envelope-o"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/paylakatel" class="fa fa-twitter"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylapatel" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a><a href="https://github.com/paylakatel" class="fa fa-github"></a></p></footer></div></body></html>
