  h3 Demographics of small-scale mining in south-central Ghana

p In this analysis, I used the previously completed land cover classification 
    | from my master's thesis with demographic data to assess the 46 districts 
    | in south-central Ghana. I located clusters of different variables using 
    | univariate and bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA). 
    | The output maps from the project are shown below.

p The demographic groups I focused on were the percent male, female, over 65, 
    | enrolled in education, monolingual, and illiterate populations within each 
    | district. I found that areas with a longer history of mining tend to have 
    | slightly more men than women, younger populations, low participation in 
    | education, more illiterate populations, and bilingual populations, while 
    | newer areas of mining tend to have older populations, more literate 
    | populations, and mono-lingual populations.

p Figures 3 and 4 show the results of the analysis. Each variable is in a 
    | separate column, the first map shows the variable displayed in each 
    | district separated into six classes using natural breaks. The second 
    | map is the output of the univariate analysis, and the third map is the 
    | output of the bivariate analysis incorporating the area of small-scale 
    | mining in each district.

p When interpreting outputs from the LISA analyses, bright red areas are
    | the centers of clusters with high-high relationships. In the univariate 
    | analysis this means the highlighted polygon has a high value of the 
    | variable of interest and is surrounded by other districts with high 
    | values of the same variable. In the bivariate analysis, a polygon 
    | highlighted in red means the district has a high area of small-scale 
    | mining surrounded by high values of the variable of interest. 

p
    | Light red areas indicate high-low relationships, a low value surrounding 
    | by high ones. Bright blue indicate low values surrounded by other low 
    | values, a low-low relationship, and light blue areas indicate a low-high 
    | relationship, low values surrounded by high ones.
