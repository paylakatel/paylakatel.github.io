    p The 
        a(href="https://imagine.boston.gov/metrics-dashboard/") Imagine Boston 2030
        |  plan was released in July 2017 as the City of Bostonâ€™s 
        | first long-term plan in 50 years. After hearing from more than 15,000 
        | residents, five major goals were outlined in the plan each of which are 
        | tracked through a series of different metrics: 
    ul 
        li Encourage affordability, reduce displacement, and improve 
            | quality of life
        li Increase access to opportunity
        li Drive inclusive economic growth
        li Promote a healthy environment and prepare for climate change  
        li Invest in open space, arts & culture, transportation, and 
            | infrastructure 
    p  
        | Using R-Shiny, I developed a  
        a(href="https://analytics.boston.gov/app/imagine-boston") public-facing dashboard
        |  that interactively 
        | displays data associated with each of the goals and metrics allowing 
        | users to quickly gain an understanding of how close we are to achieving 
        | the goals laid out in the plan.
