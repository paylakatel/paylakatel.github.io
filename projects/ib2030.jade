p The Imagine Boston 2030 
    a(href="https://imagine.boston.gov/metrics-dashboard/") plan
    |  was released in July 2017 as the City of Bostonâ€™s 
    | first long-term plan in 50 years. After hearing from more than 15,000 
    | residents, five major goals were outlined in the plan each of which are 
    | tracked through a series of different metrics: 
ul 
    li Encourage affordability, reduce displacement, and improve 
        | quality of life
    li Increase access to opportunity
    li Drive inclusive economic growth
    li Promote a healthy environment and prepare for climate change  
    li Invest in open space, arts & culture, transportation, and 
        | infrastructure 

p  
    | Using R-Shiny, I developed a  
    a(href="https://analytics.boston.gov/app/imagine-boston") public-facing dashboard
    |  that interactively 
    | displays data associated with each of the goals and metrics allowing 
    | users to quickly gain an understanding of how close we are to achieving 
    | the goals laid out in the plan. 
    
p 
    | The data for the dashboard was provided by the Boston Redevelopment Authority's 
    | research division and is updated yearly or as more data becomes available.
