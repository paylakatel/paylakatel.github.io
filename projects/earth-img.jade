  h3 Earth Images
  
p Not only does the data captured by NASA's earth observing satellites offer 
    | great opportunities for analysis, it also makes for some beautiful images. 
    | I used Landsat-8 data and GIMP, an open source image editing software, to 
    | create the statellite images seen below, and I think placing these images 
    | next to ground photos taken in those locations on the ground offers a 
    | really interesting perspective.
