from my master's thesis with demographic data to assess the 46 districts 
in south-central Ghana. I located clusters of different variables using 
univariate and bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA). 
The output maps from the project are shown below.</p><p>The demographic groups I focused on were the percent male, female, over 65, 
enrolled in education, monolingual, and illiterate populations within each 
district. I found that areas with a longer history of mining tend to have 
slightly more men than women, younger populations, low participation in 
education, more illiterate populations, and bilingual populations, while 
newer areas of mining tend to have older populations, more literate 
populations, and mono-lingual populations.<hr></p><div class="images"><div class="img"><img src="../projects/img/demo-ssm_study_area.png" alt="The study area used in the analysis is shown with the districts that were analyzed highlighted in orange.

Each variable is in a 
separate column, the first map shows the variable displayed in each 
district separated into six classes using natural breaks. The second 
map is the output of the univariate analysis, and the third map is the 
output of the bivariate analysis incorporating the area of small-scale 
mining in each district.</p><p>When interpreting outputs from the LISA analyses, bright red areas are
the centers of clusters with high-high relationships. In the univariate 
analysis this means the highlighted polygon has a high value of the 
variable of interest and is surrounded by other districts with high 
values of the same variable. In the bivariate analysis, a polygon 
highlighted in red means the district has a high area of small-scale 
mining surrounded by high values of the variable of interest. </p><p>Light red areas indicate high-low relationships, a low value surrounding 
by high ones. Bright blue indicate low values surrounded by other low 
values, a low-low relationship, and light blue areas indicate a low-high 
relationship, low values surrounded by high ones.</p><hr><div class="images"><div class="img"><img src="../projects/img/demo-ssm_output_maps_1.png" alt="Figure 3"><p class="img-title">Figure 3</p><p class="img-details">The output maps for percent male, percent female, and over 65 are shown.</p></div><div class="img"><img src="../projects/img/demo-ssm_output_maps_2.png" alt="Figure 4"><p class="img-title">Figure 4</p><p class="img-details">The output maps for percent monolingual, percent enrolled in education, and percent illterate are shown.</p></div></div><!-- jQuery--><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script><!-- bootstrap js--><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><footer> <p><a href="paylakatel@gmail.com" class=" fa fa-envelope-o"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/paylakatel" class="fa fa-twitter"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylapatel" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a><a href="https://github.com/paylakatel" class="fa fa-github"></a></p></footer></div></body></html>
