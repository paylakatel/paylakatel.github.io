The Imagine Boston 2030 <paragraph-link to="https://imagine.boston.gov/imagine-boston-plan/">plan</paragraph-link> was released in July 2017 as the City of Bostonâ€™s first long-term plan in 50 years. Creating the plan involved hearing from more than 15,000 residents, and the plan synthesizes their thoughts into five major goals and associates each with a series of metrics:

* Encourage affordability, reduce displacement, and improve quality of life
* Increase access to opportunity
* Drive inclusive economic growth
* Promote a healthy environment and prepare for climate change
* Invest in open space, arts & culture, transportation, and infrastructure

Using R-Shiny, I developed a <paragraph-link to="https://analytics.boston.gov/app/imagine-boston">public-facing dashboard</paragraph-link> that interactively displays data associated with each of the goals and metrics. The tool allows users to quickly gain an understanding of how close we are to achieving the goals laid out in the plan.

The data for the dashboard was provided by the Boston Redevelopment Authority's research division and is updated yearly or as more data becomes available.
