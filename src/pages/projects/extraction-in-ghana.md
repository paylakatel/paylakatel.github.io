In January of 2016, the journal Extractive Industries and Society accepted my masters thesis as an original research article: Evaluating conflict surrounding mineral extraction in Ghana: Assessing the spatial interactions of large and small-scale mining.The Extractive Industries and Society, Volume 3, Issue 2, April 2016, Pages 450-463, ISSN 2214-790X.

The work examines the spatial interactions of small and large-scale miners in south-central Ghana. A random forest classifier was used to identify small-scale mining in Landsat imagery, and these areas were then compared to the locations of large-scale mining concessions.

Below are are the abstract and figures from the paper.
