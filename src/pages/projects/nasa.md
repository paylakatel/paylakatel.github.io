My team worked with APNEP, Albemarle-Pamlico National Estuary Partnership, to try and develop a methodology that would allow the organization to more rapidly and consistently detect changes in wetlands throughout the watershed. We used Landsat-5, -7, and -8 data to analyze wetland health from 2000-2015 using a series of vegetation indicies. Image preprocessing and analysis was performed through a python script I wrote. Images and code snippets from the project are shown below.
