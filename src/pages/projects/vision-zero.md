Vision Zero is an international road saftey effort with the goal of ending fatalities and serious injuries related to road traffic. [Vision Zero Boston](https://www.boston.gov/transportation/vision-zero) is the City’s local program. As part of that effort, the City tracks traffic crashes and fatalities on the [Vision Zero Crash Map](https://apps.boston.gov/vision-zero/).

In Summer 2018, we re-built the crash map to bring it inline with Boston’s branding, modernize the technology stack, and automate the updating process. The map now leverages [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), and [React/NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

The crash and fatality data can be found on [Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov/dataset?organization=vision-zero-boston-program&q=vision+zero), the City’s open data portal.

The [code for the web map](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/vision-zero) can be found on github.
