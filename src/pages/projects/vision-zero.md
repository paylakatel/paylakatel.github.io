Vision Zero is an international road saftey effort with the goal of ending fatalities and serious injuries related to road traffic. Vision Zero Boston is the City’s local program. As part of that effort, the City tracks traffic crashes and fatalities on the Vision Zero Crash Map.

In Summer 2018, we re-built the crash map to bring it inline with Boston’s branding, modernize the technology stack, and automate the updating process. The map now leverages PostGIS, Mapbox GL JS, and React/NextJS.

The crash and fatality data can be found on Analyze Boston, the City’s open data portal.

The code for the map can be found on github.
