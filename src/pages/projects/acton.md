In 2016, the Town of Acton realized there was an opportunity to make important information about the Town more accessible for residents by redesigning their website.

As the Town’s webmaster, I lead the project and made sure we addressed the feedback we’d be hearing from residents: it was difficult to find information. Folks pointed out that the large nested menus were hard to navigate, having two separate and un-connected document repositories were confusing, and it was hard to know what to pay attention to when visiting the site.
