In 2016, the Town of Acton hadn’t redesigned their website since the early 2010 and realized there was an opportunity to make important information about the Town more accessible for residents.

As the Town’s webmaster, I lead the project and made sure we addressed the feedback we’d be hearing from residents: it was difficult to find information. Folks pointed out that the large nested menus were hard to navigate, having two separate and un-connected document repositories were confusing, and it was hard to know what to pay attention to when visiting the site.
