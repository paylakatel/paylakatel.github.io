As part of modernizing boston.gov, we're slowly going through the legacy web applications we have left on cityofboston.gov and moving each over to [boston.gov](https://www.boston.gov/).

We thought it was important to make the information our boards and commissions look-up tool displays easier to find on boston.gov, so we updated the app and wrote about the changes and process on the Digital Team's blog: [Boards and Commissions get a deserved boston.gov facelift](https://www.boston.gov/news/boards-and-commissions-get-deserved-bostongov-facelift).
