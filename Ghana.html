	  <h2>Evaluating conflict surrounding mineral extraction in Ghana: Assessing the spatial interactions of large and small-scale mining</h2>

	  <div><p>My research in Ghana focuses on the spatial interactions and overlaps of small and large-scale miners in an effort to gain a better understanding of the conflict surrounding extraction in the country. I preformed a classification tree analysis to identify the small-scale mining occuring throughout the study area and assess where it overlaps with existing large-scale concessions. Below are the final figures from the paper. I am currently working with my advisors to get it ready for submission to an academic journal.</p></div>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/Figure1.jpg" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br><span class="figures">Figure 1: </span>This image is of the study area. I used Landsat path/row 194/56. The hatched polygons show the locations of mineral bearing rock formations throughout the study area. </p>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/Figure2.jpg" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br>Figure 2: </span>The image above shows the locations of high resolution imagery on Google Earth that were used to preform the accuracy analysis.</p>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/Figure3.jpg" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br>Figure 3: </span>The red areas show the identified small-scale mining occurring throughout the scene. The hatched areas display existing large-scale concessions and unofficial small-scale mining concessions.</p>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/Figure4.jpg" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br>Figure 4: </span>I created maps of the three main areas of mining in Figure 3 so that readers could get a better understanding of the overlaps between the sectors. This image shows the northwest corner of the study area. This area has been actively mined for decades and is where much of the conflict between small and large-scale miners occurs.</p>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/Figure5.jpg" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br>Figure 5: </span>This image shows the southwest corner of the study area. Like the northwest area, this region has been actively mined for decades and also experienced a lot of conflict between small and large-scale miners occurs.</p>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/Figure6.jpg" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br>Figure 6: </span>This image shows the northeast corner of the study area. This region is newer to both large and small-scale mining and has experienced less conflict between the sectors.</p>
