        | Thanks for stopping by! My name is Kayla, and I currently work for the City of Boston as a Data and Performance Analyst on the Citywide Analytics team. I graduated from Clark University with my M.S. in Geographic Information Science in August 2015, and my master's research focused on the spatial interactions of large and small-scale mining in Ghana. The work was published in 
        i Extractive Industries and Society
        | as an original research article in April 2016. On this site you'll find examples of projects and work that I have completed. Feel free to send me an email with questions or comments!
