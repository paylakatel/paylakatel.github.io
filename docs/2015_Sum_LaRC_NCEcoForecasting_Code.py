"""
This script will allow the user to download data from Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 and calculate Green Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Pigment Index (NDPI), and a wetland discrimination index
(WDI) for each image.

The script uses functions from arcpy and dnppy (Develop National Program Python Library) and therefore requires an
ArcMap installation and a dnppy installation (https://github.com/nasa/dnppy).

The script first unzips the Landsat files and extracts them into their own folders. Images are group by year, with all
images taken in one year in separate folders within the year's folder. The script then calculates top of atmosphere
reflectance for each image band in order to reduce atmospheric influence in the calculation of the band ratios. The
three band ratios are then calculated and new raster images are created as results.

The function GNDVI_457 is used for calculating Green NDVI on Landsat 4, 5, and 7 data. The function uses the green and
NIR bands to calculate GNDVI the equation for which is Green band minus the Near InfraRed band divided by the Green band
plus the Near InfraRed band:

GNDVI = (green - NIR)/(green + NIR)

The function then reclasses the GNDVI image to a binary raster image, an image that only has two values: 0 and 1, by
applying and 0 threshold to the image. This threshold is the most common one found in the literature and classifies
values below 0 as water and values higher than 0 as land. The function then saves this threshold image as a new raster.
This band ratio is used to derive shoreline locations for each image to get a better sense of how
shoreline changes along the watershed are affecting wetlands. In addition, masking out areas defined as water place
more focus on the wetlands themselves and allow for a clearer visual analysis.

The function GNDVI_8 is used for calculating GNDVI on Landsat 8 data. A separate function has to be defined for Landsat
8 because of the different way bands are defined between the sensors. For Landsat 4, 5, and 7, band 1 is the blue, band
2 is green, and band 3 is red. For Landsat 8, band 2 is blue, band 3 is green, and band 4 is red. Therefore, a new GNDVI
function must be defined for Landsat 8 that uses these band numbers.
