	  <h2>Demographics of small-scale mining in south-central Ghana</h2>

	  <div><p>In this analysis, I used the previously completed land cover classification from my master's thesis in conjunction with demographic data to assess the 46 districts in south-central Ghana. I located clusters of different variables using univariate and bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA). The output maps from the project are shown below.<br><br> 

	  The demographic data I focused on were the percent male, female, over 65, enrolled in education, monolingual, and illiterate populations within each district. I found that areas with a longer history of mining tend to have slightly more men than women, younger populations, low participation in education, more illiterate populations, and bilingual populations, while newer areas of mining tend to have older populations, more literate populations, and mono-lingual populations.</p></div> <br>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/GISIntDev_StudyArea.png" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br><span class="figures">Figure 1: </span>This map shows the study area used in this analysis with the districts that were analyzed highlighted in orange. The Landsat-8 footprint that defined the study area for my thesis work is shown as well. <br><br> 

	  	Within this study area there are two main areas of extraction where both small and large-scale mining are taking place. The first region starts near the Obuasi mine and extends down to the Tarkwa, Teberebie and Nsuta mines. This area has been being mined since the early 1800s, the small-scale miners in these areas tend to be generational and use mining as their primary form of income generation. The other area is the in the eastern part of the image, near the Konogo, Akyem, and Akwatia mines. This region is newer to extraction and the small-scale miners in this area tend to be primarily farmers who participate in mining to supplement their diminishing farming income. </p>

	  	<p><img src="./Images/GISIntDev_SSMperDistrict.png" alt = ""/ width="90%" align="center"></br><span class="figures">Figure 2: </span>The area in square kilometers of small-scale mining happening with in each district is shown here. The land cover classification data only went as far as the bounds of the Landsat scene, therefore there is likely an underestimation of the amount of small-scale mining occuring within the border districts.</p><br>

	  	<p><strong>Figures 3 and 4</strong> show the results of the analysis. Each variable is in a separate column, the first map shows the variable displayed in each district separated into six classes using natural breaks. The second map is the output of the univariate analysis, and the third map is the output of the bivariate analysis incorporating the area of small-scale mining in each district.<br><br>

	    When interpreting outputs from the LISA analyses, bright red areas are the centers of clusters with high-high relationships. In the univariate analysis this means the highlighted polygon has a high value of the variable of interest and is surrounded by other districts with high values of the same variable. In the bivariate analysis, a polygon highlighted in red means the district has a high area of small-scale mining surrounded by high values of the variable of interest. <br><br>

	  	Light red areas indicate high-low relationships, a low value surrounding by high ones. Bright blue indicate low values surrounded by other low values, a low-low relationship, and light blue areas indicate a low-high relationship, low values surrounded by high ones.<p>
