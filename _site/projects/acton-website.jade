  h3 Website Redesign for the Town of Acton
  h4 September 2015 - June 2016

p In 2016, the Town of Acton hadn’t redesigned their website since the early 
  | 2010 and realized there was an opportunity to make important information 
  | about the Town more accessible for residents. 

p As the Town’s webmaster, I lead the project and made sure we addressed the 
  | feedback we’d be hearing from residents: it was difficult to find  
  | information. Folks pointed out that the large nested menus 
  | were hard to navigate, having two separate and un-connected document 
  | repositories were confusing, and it was hard to know what to pay attention 
  | to when visiting the site.

p We addressed these concerns in a variety of different ways when thinking 
  | about the new site:
ul 
  li We made the homepage longer and stopped compressing everything we 
    | needed to fit onto the page in a small area. Doing that allowed us to 
    | separate out content into sections: News & Events, Online Services, 
    | Ongoing Activity, and Connect With Us that were more intuitive for users. 
  li We realized most users use our search bar to find what they’re 
    | looking for, so we increased it’s size and moved it to a prominent 
    | location on the page.
  li We integrated our site with our other documents repository: 
    a(href="http://doc.acton-ma.gov/dsweb/HomePage") docushare 
    | , using a Google Site Searches to help people find information 
    | across the two sites.
